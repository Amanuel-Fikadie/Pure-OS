# PureOS-Linux-Documentation
## Documentation Description
This project documents the installation, configuration, and system-level exploration of the PureOS Linux distribution in a virtualized environment using both Oracle VM VirtualBox and VMware Workstation. It provides terminal-based instructions for setting up PureOS, handling installation issues, and working with the ext4 filesystem.
Key tools used include:
VBoxManage for VM management,
apt for package installation,
and core Linux commands for disk partitioning, user management, and service control.
The project emphasizes Free Software Foundation (FSF) principles, system call analysis, and OS-level problem-solving, making it a practical guide for students learning operating systems, system administration, and low-level programming. All configurations reflect best practices for transparency, security, and digital freedom.
## System-Call Description
This project demonstrates how to modify a processâ€™s CPU scheduling priority using the nice() system call in C. The implementation shows how to:
Retrieve the current nice value using getpriority(),
Increase the nice value to lower priority,
Run and observe priority-based behavior changes.
This example illustrates how user-space programs interact with kernel-level process scheduling, forming the foundation for understanding system resource control, real-time programming, and multi-tasking environments.
